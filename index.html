      Smart materials are materials that react due to an environmental change such as temperature, light, electricity and pressure. When reacting to these  
      changes they may change shape or colour and in some cases even produce an electrical current. Some examples of these materials are shape memory alloys 
      (SMAs), piezoelectric materials and self-healing polymers. Smart materials are used in various  industries due to their versatility and wide range of 
      materials. They are incredibly useful to designers and engineers who need a material that can improve a product and increase the product’s life span. 
      They’re continuously evolving alongside new technologies and are being used more in industry. The hope is that smart materials will be used more to push 
      forwards a more sustainable and non-polluting environment. As a result of this, pollution would reduce and companies and consumers carbon footprint would 
      reduce, which will help reduce the concerning effects of global warming.

      Smart materials are materials that respond to changes in their environment such as light, temperature or electricity. Examples of smart materials are 
      shape memory alloys (SMAs), piezoelectric materials and thermochromic coatings. They are used in various industries such as automotive, aerospace, 
      construction and healthcare. Certain smart materials only react to certain changes in their environment and they react when exposed to these 
      environmental changes. Reactions that occur are, change in shape, change in colour, and producing an electrical current. The use of smart materials 
      could aid companies and consumers to reduce waste, save costs and improve performance. They also may help to save energy and materials, for example in 
      the construction industry temperature-sensitive glass may be used to save energy. As technologies evolve these materials will advance and become more 
      efficient and be used more in industry which will hopefully promote a more sustainable and eco-friendly environment in the future. This will help 
      companies and consumers to save money and reduce waste that could harm the environment.

      What are smart materials?
      Smart materials are materials that detect changes in their environment and react to these changes in a constructive manner. The reactions that may occur 
      involve changing form (shape), colour, or producing an electrical current.
      There are many different types of smart materials and different ones react differently to  a change in their environment. A shape memory alloy which 
      means that it can return to its original shape when a change to its environment occurs an example is nitinol, which is an alloy of nickel and titanium, 
      and if it is deformed heat is applied to it to change it back to its original shape. Piezoelectric materials generate electricity when a force is applied 
      to them, either stretching or compressive forces, and when electricity is applied to them they also change their shape. Thermochromic materials change 
      colour based on the temperature. Finally,self-healing polymers which are polymers that can repair themselves, to a certain degree, if they are deformed 
      or broken. This will help to increase a product's life span and save costs as the product will not need to be replaced as often.


      Applications of smart materials in industry:
      Medical: Nitinol is used in dentistry for wires for braces where the body temperature in the patient's mouth changes the nitinol back to the perfect arch 
      that the material was pre-set to, as the nitinol reverts back to its original shape it applies a light pressure to the patients teeth which, in time, will 
      straighten the patients teeth to their desired preference. 
      Automotive: Piezoelectric materials are used in the automotive industry for things like sensors.“For instance, piezoelectric material sensors are used to 
      measure different qualities such as pressure, acceleration and vibration.” (Reddy et al., 2024). What makes them good for sensors is that they are very 
      sensitive which allows for little changes such as a pressure change to be noticed fast by the operator. They also do not require a power source which 
      saves electricity and allows the batteries to last longer in automotive vehicles
      Aerospace: Thermochromic materials may possibly be used in spacecraft by NASA, which is a well renowned space agency that has been around for nearly 60 
      years. NASA has created some design targets that their thermochromic variable emittance coatings (VECs) will achieve such as emitting thermal (heat) 
      energy to reduce energy consumption for space vehicles and also reducing mass of space vehicles as more simplistic cooling system would be used instead. 
      (Peoples et al., 2021)
      Construction: Self-healing polymers are used in construction by putting them into concrete. By doing this the polymers could help to repair small cracks 
      in the concrete which would help to further reinforce it and increase the concrete’s life span.(Choi et al., 2023). This sort of concrete is an adaptation 
      of pre-existing self-healing concrete used by the Romans over 2000 years ago. Notably, one of the most famous uses of their self-healing concrete is the 
      Pantheon, which is the largest unreinforced concrete dome currently, even though it is over 2000 years old. The reason we do not currently use this sort 
      of concrete is that it is not strong and durable enough for modern day construction.
        
      Conclusion:
      To sum this all up, the use of smart materials are a beneficial aid to the main industries as there are a large variety of them. They are durable, long 
      lasting and versatile which could allow for even more industries to incorporate them into their fields of expertise. They are currently being used more 
      often for example nitinol is being used more and it is projected to be used even more in the near future as it can be used for multiple applications in 
      multiple industries.(Precedence Research, 2025).  As the table below shows, the market size of nitinol is expected to more than double in the near future.
      This displays companies are interested in using nitinol more in industry and that it may be a highly useful material in the development of future technology.
